This is the first public release of my fork of Tiago Barroso's *Syntax Highlighting for Code* add-on. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of what he has done for the Anki community over the years.

This update is meant to carry on his legacy by adding Anki 2.1 support, implementing some long-requested features, and refactoring major parts of the codebase. All of this was made possible through the generous support of a fellow Anki user who would like to remain anonymous.

An overview of the most important changes in this release follows below:

### Added

- **New**: Anki 2.1 compatibility
- **New**: Option to apply syntax highlighting via CSS (thanks to [Tim Rae](https://github.com/timrae/SyntaxHighlight)!)
- **New**: Ability to customize language selection and hotkey
- **New**: Ability to customize [syntax highlighting theme](https://help.farbox.com/pygments.html)
- **New**: Upgraded pygments from v1.6 to v2.2.0. This is a [major jump](http://pygments.org/docs/changelog/#version-2-2-0) and should come with a lot of added functionality in terms of supported languages and language features

### Fixed

- **Fixed**: Position options dialog correctly
- **Fixed**: Various improvements and bug fixes (e.g. the ImportErrors and KeyErrors frequently reported in earlier reviews)

## 2.0.0-beta - 2018-02-27
